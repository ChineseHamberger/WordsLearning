Our editor-in-chief has shared a heartfelt tribute to our cherished readers. Dear Readers, It is with a heavy heart that we share the news of Reader's Digest UK coming to a close. This magazine carries a profound legacy, holding special memories for so many—whether it adorned our parents’ coffee tables or served as a gateway to the English language for those abroad. Its closure marks the end of an era that is deeply felt. To every subscriber, I extend my heartfelt thanks for your unwavering support, loyalty, and encouragement throughout the years. Your letters, poems, essays and photographs have filled our pages with life and heart. Each story shared has woven a beautiful tapestry of human experiences, connecting us all in profound ways. During my eight-year journey with this publication, serving as editor for the past six years has been a true honour and joy. I am grateful for the opportunity to have led such a cherished magazine and to have been a part of your lives through its pages.
