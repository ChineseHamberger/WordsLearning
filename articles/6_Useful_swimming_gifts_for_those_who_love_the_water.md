Outer ear infections (otitis externa) cause redness and swelling around the ear canal, ear pain, discharge and sometimes slight hearing loss. To protect your ears, the WaterDam swimming ear plugs sit snugly in your outer ear, helping to repel water as you swim. Made with a one-piece design and heat protection at temperatures up to 200°C, these swimming plugs avoid pieces breaking off or melting, keeping the inside of your ears safe while you are active.

Easy to fit and they work like a charm.” View product This warming Winthome dry robe for wild swimmers The most important thing to be wary of as an open water swimmer is the after-drop, where swimmers lose up to 4.5°C of their body temperature after exiting the water—staying warm at this point is crucial. When you swim in cold water, your body helps you cope with the frigid temperatures by diverting circulation away from your skin and to your core. But on exiting the water, this cooling process does not stop immediately, making hypothermia a risk. A good quality dry robe is a solid investment for wild swimmers, as it staves off this cooling effect by keeping wearers warm and toasty. This one by Winthome is made with a thick layer of polar fleece, with long sleeves and a snug hood. It is also ideally shaped for changing your clothes underneath—helping you to protect your modesty in the outdoors! Promising review: “I love this wetcoat. So much room, very warm and almost goes to my feet. Just what I want when I get out of the water, particularly on a cold winter’s day!” View product This arresting reflection on the culture and history of swimming, Why We Swim by Bonnie Tsui For a species so well adapted to landlubbing, humans have spent an impressively long time entering the water. The first evidence of swimming can be found in cave paintings in the Saraha, dating back 10,000 years, and we’re still finding excuses to cross the watery frontier. In Why We Swim, Bonnie Tsui unravels this strange compulsion. Unlike other animals, we cannot swim from birth, and yet we still go to the trouble to teach ourselves, whether for survival, fitness, pleasure, or reasons more philosophical. Weaving investigation with memoir, Tsui meets the Icelandic man who survived six hours in the icy sea after his boat capsized, traces the ancient samurai who swam in their armour, remembers the campaign to win African Americans access to the U.S.’s public swimming pools, and more besides. What emerges is a fascinating and tender overview of our relationship with water and the strokes that let us explore its depths. Promising review: “Wonderfully written book about the reasons why we swim and the joy of swimming. Full of facts, stories and adventures. A book to languish in and get inspired to immerse yourself in that beautiful aquatic world.” View product This post contains affiliate links, so we may earn a small commission when you make a purchase through links on our site at no additional cost to you.
