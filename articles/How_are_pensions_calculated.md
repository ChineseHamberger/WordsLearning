# How are pensions calculated?

With different kinds of pension schemes available and amounts paid into them during your career, this is how pensions are calculated If you live and work in the UK, there are three principal ways you can create a pension that can provide an income when you retire. These are the state pension, the workplace pension, and the pension you set up yourself. State pension You can access this regular payment from the government when you reach state pension age. The amount you receive is calculated according to the number of "qualifying" years of National Insurance payments you have made, consisting of contributions you have paid when working and also contributions credited to you when you are unable to work. Currently, state pension age in the UK is now 66 for both women and men. However, for those born after 5 April 1960, there will be a phased increase in state pension age to 67, and later on to 68. Workplace pension This is essentially a long-term savings plan that benefits from both tax relief and employer contributions. It is only accessible after reaching a certain age. At present the earliest age is 55 in the UK, but set to rise to 57 in 2028. Private pension This is a pension you can set up yourself either if you are ineligible for a workplace pension, for example if you are self-employed, or if you want to increase the retirement funds you will receive from your state and workplace pensions.
