# Ideal holiday destinations for each zodiac sign

As summer swiftly approaches and the longing for an escape from the dreary British weather intensifies, which holiday destinations align the most with your zodiac sign? With summer just around the corner, BonusFinder.co.uk sought to discover the ideal holiday destination for each zodiac sign based on their astrocartography lines (a form of locational astrology which allows people to decipher which physical locations are best suited to them based on their birth chart) with the help of celebrity psychic and astrologer Inbaal Honigman. 1. Capricorn (December 22-January 19): Melbourne Melbourne is a great place to visit for friendly Capricorns. Credit: Dmitry Osipenko Mature and hardworking, a Capricorn likes diversity and friendliness, and the best place for this is Melbourne. Named the friendliest city in the world and home to the exotic Royal Botanical Gardens, a Capricorn will feel right at home here. A more extraordinary idea would be Solomon Islands, for world class SCUBA diving and why not brave a tour of Skull Island? 2. Aquarius (Jan 20-Feb 18): New Zealand January is the month of Aquarians—unique and free-thinking, they will want to get truly lost in nature in New Zealand. With luscious open spaces and an abundance of beautiful scenery, Aquarians can do just that. Or go off the beaten track with a visit to Fiji, including a trip to an adventure park or a stroll through the marina. 3. Pisces (Feb 19-March 20): Hawaii Romantic and shy Pisces' ideal travel destination is Hawaii, surrounded by water and an expanse of warm beaches. With volcanic national parks and surfing clear waters, Pisces will love getting back in touch with their aquatic roots. The dreamy destination of Cook Islands is a wonderful alternative, so check out their mountain hikes and quadbike trips. 4. Aries (March 21-April 19): Alaska Alaska has stunning landscapes that Aries would enjoy. Credit: Sara Loeffler Active and unusual Aries would be best adventuring through the idyllic landscapes of Alaska. Home to some of the world's most beautiful views and the largest national park, Aries will always have somewhere to explore here. Or find yourself in the achingly cool Portland, Oregon for some bike rides and long conversations in unique coffee shops and the many art galleries. 5. Taurus (April 20-May 20): Los Angeles Great food and extensive views are a true joy to a Taurus, and it doesn't get bigger and bolder than Los Angeles; with over 30,000 restaurants and stunning wide-open beaches, Taurus will love everything about LA. Or go incognito in bustling Santiago in Chile, with dramatic views of the Andes on the one side, and the coast on the other. 6. Gemini (May 21-June 20): New York Always awake and ready to party, Geminis will fall in love with the city that never sleeps, New York! From visiting the Metropolitan Museum of Art to watching an extravagant Broadway show, Geminis will never be bored day or night. Or for that once in a lifetime experience, take in Christ the Redeemer in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and check out the world famous Ipanema beach. 7. Cancer (June 21-July 22): Iceland For a dreamy and easy-going Cancer, Iceland is the destination of choice. Between magical views of the northern lights and geothermal lagoons, Cancer will never tire of relaxing in one with nature. Or take a peaceful family break in Madeira, Portugal, and enjoy the quiet beaches and the Monte Palace Tropical Garden. 8. Leo (July 23-August 22): Bordeaux Bordeaux is a beautiful city to visit for Leos who love wine. Credit: Borja Lopez The luxury fiend Leo must visit Bordeaux, the historic capital of Aquitaine, famous for its excellent wine culture. Between scenic beaches and exclusive vineyard tours, Leos will be able to find their true self. Or make memories that last a lifetime, by visiting Norway’s Tromso for the Polar Museum and the breath taking majestic fjords. 9. Virgo (August 23-September 22): Rome The ideal destination for the neat and traditional Virgo is Rome, where they will undoubtedly relish an enlightening guided tour of the city's ancient architecture and feel at home in the chic modern shopping areas. Go off the beaten track with Lalibela in Ethiopia, and marvel at the distinctive rock-hewn churches of the region. 10. Libra (September 23-October 22): UAE Classy and elegant Libras would adore the high rises in the desert of the United Arab Emirates; between luxury hotels and a mass of incredible culture, Libras will love discovering what this country has to offer. Or submerge yourself in the sounds and colours of Delhi in India, at the incredible Akshardham Temple, and don’t miss a trip to the world famous Taj Mahal. 11. Scorpio (October 23-November 21): Sri Lanka Mysterious and original Scorpios can enjoy going off-grid in the temples of Sri Lanka. While exploring the rich heritage of the Gangaramaya Temple or coming up close to wildlife, Scorpios may find a little serendipity. Or Bangkok in Thailand, where you can take in the shrines and temples, not forgetting the specialised food tours available throughout the city. 12. Sagittarius (November 22-December 21): Tokyo The lively streets of Tokyo are a must-visit if you're a Sagittarius. Credit: Aleksandar Pasaric The adventurous and well-travelled Sagittarius will love the unique streets and incomparable cuisine of Tokyo. Between climbing the Tokyo tower and sightseeing Mt Fuji, Sagittariuses will always have things to explore. Perth in Australia is an ideal Sagittarius destination, where you can go up the Bell Tower, or get in a campervan for an unforgettable road trip along the coast. Inbaal Honigman, celebrity psychic and astrologer, explains: “Applying astrology to wellbeing, romance or shopping is increasingly popular, but astrocartography isn't often consulted... yet. “Astrocartography is an extension of each individual's star chart so that you can find the best locations for yourself worldwide. For example, the ‘Sun Line’ would be where you feel most yourself. Your ‘Venus Line’ is the best place to build your home, and Jupiter is the best place for holidays.” Banner photo: New York by Mitchell Luo Keep up with the top stories from Reader's Digest by subscribing to our weekly newsletter
