# 5 Reasons to experience an American-style motel-diner in the UK

A classic American-style motel-diner experience brought up to date, Mollie’s provides the opportunity to stay and eat this unique way in multiple locations in the UK Picture the scene—you’ve pulled in off the main road to a neon “Motel” sign to get a room for the night and rest your weary bones. You check in and drop your bags, then stroll across the car park to another building underneath the neon “Diner” sign for a burger and shake, with live music in the background, before you turn in. This isn’t Middle America though, this is leafy, rural Oxfordshire (on the A420 at Buckland), 30 minutes from the centre of Oxford. Mollie’s is bringing the classic American motel-diner experience to the UK, while bringing it up to date and adding a fresh style to the equation. It's a different way to enjoy a stay. Here are five highlights that make the Mollie’s experience such a must-visit. 1. Updated Americana in Oxfordshire The Americana feel of Mollie's Motel & Diner is really fun and combines retro and modern elements. Credit: Ian Chaddock If you’ve ever been to the US (or watched any Hollywood films really!), you’ve probably stayed or come across the cultural classic that is the motel. There’s not really anything quite like it in the UK really… until now. It’s a great concept, brought up to date. From the large neon signs marking Mollie’s as an exciting Americana-influenced destination to the counter at the diner, where you can sit and drink coffee if you’d like, the easy-going vibe with a dash of vintage will bring a smile to your face. 2. Delicious diner food Everything from burgers and shakes to cheesecake and eggs is available at Mollie's Diner.

Mollie’s Diner Oxfordshire has an affordable and delectable all-day menu, breakfast menu and kid’s menu, there’s truly something for everyone. The open kitchen with chrome, Cadillac booths and Friday night live music (Molly Green playing modern jazz versions of favourites “Hit the Road Jack” and “What’s Love Got to Do With It” when I was there) make it an essential pit-stop, whether you’re staying at the motel or not. There’s some tasty veggie options too, like frickles, plant burgers, as well as eggs all day that are a perfect brunch treat. There’s even an outdoor heated terrace where dogs are welcome! 3. High-spec contemporary rooms The rooms at Mollie's Motel are contemporary and hi-spec, providing a relaxing and stylish place to rest for a night.

The Cotswold countryside is just on the doorstep and in this relaxing setting you’re sure to get the restful night’s sleep you need. There’s also friendly workspaces in the lobby with free coffee that’s Mollie’s own blend and a general store with any additional products you might need (such as sleep kits and cleaning kits). 4.
