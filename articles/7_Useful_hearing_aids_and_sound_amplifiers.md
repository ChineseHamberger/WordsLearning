# 7 Useful hearing aids and sound amplifiers

Hearing aids and amplifiers can prove to be an invaluable tool for the hard of hearing in getting by with everyday life Hearing loss is a natural sign of ageing in later life but that doesn’t mean you have to resign yourself to being hard of hearing forever. Advancements in technology have made hearing aids more affordable, noise reducing, and easy to operate. There’s also research and trials being done into gene therapy, with the hopes of hearing loss reversal being on offer as a treatment at some point in the future. However, current amplifiers can come with different frequencies to adapt to noise levels in different environments. Here are a few solid choices if you’re on the lookout for a new pair. Note: Always consult your GP or doctor over concerns or experiences with hearing loss.
