Advantages of a savings account Opting for savings means that you can access your cash more easily than with a pension. They are relatively easy and quick to set up, and if you have an ISA allowance, your savings returns grow free of tax. You also have a personal savings allowance—the total amount of interest you can earn each year (excluding ISAs) without paying tax. Disadvantages of a savings account Cash savings can lose value over time due to inflation, and they do not enjoy the same level of tax advantages as a pension. Conclusion So, pension or savings or both? Pensions perform better because of the tax relief available. But savings are much easier to access.
